    <p>Elliot was asked to be a flower girl in her uncle's wedding in New York. The wedding was the best wedding I had ever been to. This is my favorite picture of Elliot. She is so beautiful!

      <img id="Coraline also was a flower girl" src="images/Coraline.jpg" style="width:200px;height:350px">
      <p>Coraline was also a flower girl in the wedding. This picture was taken a few years ago with Coraline posing with a flower she found in our backyard. She is so happy all the time. I do hope she stays this happy forever!
