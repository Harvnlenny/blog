    Elliot was asked to be a flower girl in her uncle's wedding in New York. 
    The wedding was the best wedding I had ever been to. 
    This is my favorite picture of Elliot. She is so beautiful!

    Coraline was also a flower girl in the wedding. 
    This picture was taken a few years ago with Coraline posing with a flower she found in our backyard. 
    She is so happy all the time. I do hope she stays this happy forever!
